A package for ROS continuous evaluation 1 (2018) 

The package allows to simulate centralized controf of a platoon of vehicles.
A very unreasonable platoon control, but simple enough in terms of inter-
node communications for evaluation 1!
Vehicle "i" in the platoon is controlled based on the position of the leader
only (irrespective of where preceding vehicles are) and its rank in the 
platoon, the control aiming to keep vehicle "i" at a distance i*safe_dis
from the leader.
